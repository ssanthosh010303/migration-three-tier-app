## Overview

This project is a three-tier web architecture built using Amazon Web Services (AWS). The architecture is designed to host a scalable and reliable web application, dividing it into three logical tiers: **Presentation Tier (Tier-1)**, **Application Tier (Tier-2)**, and **Database Tier (Tier-3)**. Each tier serves a distinct role in the application stack, ensuring a clear separation of concerns, better scalability, and improved security.
